Hello!
In this project I used an AutoEncoder with Convolutional Layers to color images.
The model is trained using grayscale images as an input and color images as targets, it learns how to properly color a given image.
You can find all files in the repo including: network I used, script for data prep, training script and more. Enjoy!
